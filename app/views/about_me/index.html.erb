  Hello, my name is Greg Donnell.  I have been a software engineer since 2011 and graduated college 
  in 2015.  During college, I freelanced for a MysticNet marketing doing PHP, worked on the graduate
   tracking program for my college in C#, and worked on many Python projects for classes.

  Since graduating, I have worked at IBM doing Android development for Workspaces.  After IBM, I 
  went to work for Google doing Java development for their Compliance team.  The compliance team 
  works on processes that every single one of Google's payment profiles has to go through.

  Outside of work, I like to spend time with my girlfriend and pets.  I have a dog, two cats, and 
  nine fish.  I also spend time working on different hobbies such as electronics, making model kits,
   working out, and now blogging!
